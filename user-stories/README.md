0. Documenting Project Features and Functionalities
mandatory

Objective: Identify and document the key features and functionalities of the Airbnb Clone project.

Instructions:

    Review the project requirements for the Airbnb Clone backend here.

    Using Draw.io, create a detailed document that lists all the features and functionalities the backend needs to support. This should include user authentication, property management, booking system, and payments.

    Export your design as a PNG file and store it in a directory called features-and-functionalities/ within your GitHub repository alx-airbnb-project-documentation.

    Commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository.

Repo:

    GitHub repository: alx-airbnb-project-documentation
    Directory: features-and-functionalities/
    File: README.md

1. Design the Use Case Diagram of the Features and Functionalities
mandatory

Objective: Visualize system interactions using a use case diagram.

Instructions:

    Based on the features outlined in Task 1, use Draw.io to create a use case diagram that visualizes the interactions between users and the system for key functionalities like user registration, property booking, and payments.

    Ensure that all key actors and interactions are captured in the diagram.

    Export your diagram as a PNG file and store it in a directory called use-case-diagram/ within your GitHub repository alx-airbnb-project-documentation.

    Commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository.

    File: README.md

2. Convert Your Use Case Diagram to User Stories
mandatory

Objective: Translate use case diagram interactions into user stories.

Instructions:

    Using the use case diagram from Task 1, convert each use case into a relevant user story. Example: “As a user, I want to be able to register an account so that I can list my properties.”

    Write at least 5 user stories that capture the core interactions from the use case diagram.

    Create a file named user-stories.md in the directory user-stories/ within your GitHub repository alx-airbnb-project-documentation and document your user stories there.

    Commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository

    File: user-stories.md,README.md

3. Design a Data Flow Diagram for Your Features and Functionalities
mandatory

Objective: Create a data flow diagram (DFD) to map the data flow within the system.

Instructions:

    Based on the features and functionalities identified in Task 1, design a Data Flow Diagram (DFD) using Draw.io that illustrates how data moves through the system. Include key entities like users, properties, bookings, and payments.

    The DFD should cover data inputs, processes, and outputs for core backend operations.

    Export your diagram as a PNG file as data-flow.png and store it in a directory called data-flow-diagram/ within your GitHub repository alx-airbnb-project-documentation.

    Commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository.

    GitHub repository: alx-airbnb-project-documentation
    Directory: data-flow-diagram/

4. Design a Flowchart for System Processes
mandatory

Objective: Map the workflow and processes of the backend features.

Instructions:

    Choose one of the key backend processes (e.g., user registration, property booking) and design a flowchart in Draw.io to visualize the steps and data flow for this process.

    Export the flowchart as a PNG and store it in the flowcharts directory under the alx-airbnb-project-documentation GitHub repository.

    Commit and push the changes to your repository.

Repo:

    GitHub repository: alx-airbnb-project-documentation
    Directory: flowcharts/
    File: data-flow-diagram.png

5. Write Requirement Specifications for Backend Features
mandatory

Objective: Document the technical and functional requirements for each feature.

Instructions:

    Write detailed requirement specifications for at least three key backend features from Task 1 (e.g., User Authentication, Property Management, Booking System).

    Include API endpoints, input/output specifications, validation rules, and performance criteria.
        Document this in a requirements.md file and store it in the root directory of the alx-airbnb-project-documentation GitHub repository.

    Commit and push the changes to your repository.
